# AVR32 Breakout "Copper"

![product](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/theatrus/copper-avr32-breakout/master/copper.jpg)

A breakout board for the AVR32 UC3B series of
processors. Specifically, the UC3B1256, a 48 pin part with 256KiB of
Flash (http://www.atmel.com/devices/AT32UC3B1256.aspx).

The year was 2009, and the Cortex-M3 was just a glimmer on some
product roadmaps. Yet Atmel delivered a 32-bit micro-controller which
was really efficient, had good performance, and was easy to use.

Modern designs should use a well-supported Cortex-M series part (M3,
M4, M0)
